Question 4. Write a short note on Tag and element with an example.
answer:
Tag- tag is a fundamental component used to define and structure content within a document.
Tags are composed of angle brackets (< and >) and typically come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. 
The opening tag marks the beginning of an element, and the closing tag marks the end. 
The content placed between the opening and closing tags defines the element's content.
Element- element is a complete set of tags along with the content they enclose. 
Elements represent the building blocks of an HTML document and contribute to the structure and presentation of the content on a webpage.

Example 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Tag and Element Example</title>
</head>
<body>

    <!-- The following is an example of an HTML element -->
    <p>This is a paragraph element. It contains some text.</p>

    <!-- Another example with an anchor (link) element -->
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>

</body>
</html>

Answer:
DOCTYPE, is an instruction in an HTML document that specifies the version of HTML or XHTML the document is written in.
 It is placed at the very beginning of the HTML document, before the <html> tag.
 The DOCTYPE declaration helps web browsers to correctly interpret and render the HTML document.
